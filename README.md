### ‚ú® Features

* **Randomized Quote Generation**: Unveil a new, hand-picked Dostoevsky quote with a simple click of a button. The application's core functionality is a randomized selection algorithm to ensure a fresh experience each time.
* **Aesthetically Pleasing UI**: The design features a modern, dark theme with subtle "glassmorphism" effects, creating a deep and immersive atmosphere. It's an experience built to complement the weighty philosophical themes of the author.
* **Dynamic Background**: An animated particle system and a faint, ethereal portrait of Dostoevsky himself add a layer of visual depth, inviting you to lose yourself in thought. The UI is built to be both beautiful and lightweight.
* **Mobile-First Design**: The application is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on a variety of screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones. It's built to look great and function perfectly everywhere.
* **Quote Tracking**: A simple counter tracks the number of quotes you've discovered, providing a subtle sense of progress and encouraging continued use.
* **Pure Front-End**: This project is built without any external frameworks or libraries, demonstrating the power and capability of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### üíª Technologies Used

This project is a testament to the power of fundamental web technologies. It is entirely self-contained within a single `index.html` file, which encapsulates all the necessary code.

* **HTML5**: Provides the semantic structure of the page, including the quote card, buttons, and statistics.
* **CSS3**: Responsible for all the styling, animations, and the unique visual aesthetics of the application. Key features like the `backdrop-filter` for the glass effect and `@keyframes` for the animations are used to bring the design to life.
* **JavaScript**: Powers the core logic, including the quote randomization, UI updates, and the dynamic behavior of the app. It manages the user interaction and data flow without the need for a back-end.
